# Full Stack Fest 2018

This week we (Jeroen, Niek, Gertjan, Eric and Kike) are enjoying [Full Stack Fest 2018 Barcelona](https://2018.fullstackfest.com/),
a week-long full stack development conference with a focus on solving current problems with new & inspiring perspectives.

In this quite short blog we just summarizing briefly the talks and **our opinion** about the talks. We have rated all talks, the rating is subjective as well.

First of all we would like to thank [Reginald Braithwaite](https://twitter.com/raganwald) for hosting the sessions.

## Day one

### Building peer-to-peer apps with the Beaker Browser
rating: :star: :star: :star: :star:

[Tara Vancil](dat://taravancil.com/about/), during the backend days we already are informed about the lack of freedom is our social networks, and how this could be solved with decentralized social networks. Tara showed that the web has the same problem. Do you remember Geocities? Yepz thoses sites are gone. And deploying or customizing web apps is still hard. Would it not be great we can fix it just in the browser the app we loved the most. Tara showed how easy you can run, customize and deploy a decentralized web app.


### To push, or not to push?! - The future of HTTP/2 server push
rating: :star: :star: :star: :star:

Patrick Hamann [#patrickhamann](https://twitter.com/patrickhamann), resource loading is still hard, performance in the browser is tightly copuled to latency connection costs are high and scipt execution is expensive. Patrick explained how to use resources wisely, make a difference between critical resourses, resourse in the users viewport and non critical. By using preload, push and async push together with a strategy of critical resource a hugh step can be made for a high performing web app. See the slides [here](https://noti.st/patrickhamann/9GvEed/to-push-or-not-to-push)

### Building a Modern Memex
rating: :star: :star: :star: :star: :star:

Andrew Louis [@hyfen](https://twitter.com/hyfen), Inmagine you can manage all your data with a single device.... An idea that goes back to the 1945 when Vanneva Bush discribed the [Memex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex). Andrew build his own Memex and demo the awesome combination fo all the data he collected over the years. Absolutely crazy to see that he is able to search back in time which podcast he was listing when driving from A to B. To be able to combine all your data from Google, Spotifiy, Maps, Whatsapp and so on you probably need a complex system. But Andrew handles it all just with Grails, VueJS and Postgres. And how cool it is all [open source](https://hyfen.net/memex/).

Progressive web apps
