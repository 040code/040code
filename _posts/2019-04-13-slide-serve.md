> Thursday I presented at [Gitlab Connect Benelux](https://about.gitlab.com/events/gitlab-connect-benelux/) about how we start using [Gitlab](http://gitlab.com) in Philips. I got some questions about my slides, what tool I used.

These are the [slides](https://gitlab-connect-amsterdam.now.sh/). We're not talking about the content, but at the style. The [Takahashi method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takahashi_method)
# History

The first time I saw a presentation the Takahashi way was [Gone in 60 Milliseconds: Offensive Security in the Serverless Age](https://conferences.codegram.com/talks/gone-in-60-milliseconds:-offensive-security-in-the-serverless-age-fsf2017) by Rich Jones on FullStackFest 2017.
