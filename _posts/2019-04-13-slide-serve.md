> Thursday I presented at [Gitlab Connect Benelux](https://about.gitlab.com/events/gitlab-connect-benelux/) about how we start using [Gitlab](http://gitlab.com) in Philips. I got some questions about my [slides](https://gitlab-connect-amsterdam.now.sh/), what tool I used.

In this post we're not talking about the content, but at the style. The [Takahashi method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takahashi_method)

# History

The first time I saw a presentation the Takahashi way was [Gone in 60 Milliseconds: Offensive Security in the Serverless Age](https://conferences.codegram.com/talks/gone-in-60-milliseconds:-offensive-security-in-the-serverless-age-fsf2017) by Rich Jones on FullStackFest 2017.
I noticed that I was immediately hooked into the presentation. No big slides with to much to read, you don't have time to look at your phone, because every slide is only visible for max 1 second. Of course this was mainly caused by the awesome presentation of Rich Jones, but also the presentation style was adding a lot to this.

# What does Takahashi method mean
> [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takahashi_method): "The Takahashi method is a technique deploying extremely simple and distilled visual slides for presentations."

This is how it looks.

This was approx 1 second of the presentation.

Look at the recording of [Gone in 60 Milliseconds: Offensive Security in the Serverless Age](https://conferences.codegram.com/talks/gone-in-60-milliseconds:-offensive-security-in-the-serverless-age-fsf2017) to see it in combination with the speaker's comments.
